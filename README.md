Unforunately we were not able to complete the project. Basic GUI functionallity exist. HugeInt, our unsigned integer class does not work 100%. Addition, subtract, and multiply work fine, but division and mod go into an infinite loop if the divisor is not a multiple. Blocking does not work, unblocking does not work, key creation does not work, and encryption/decryption does not work.
